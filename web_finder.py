"""
RESTFUL Web Service Demo

In this  demo,  you  are  required  to  implement  a  Python script with the name ‚Äòweb_finder.py‚Äô to provide two RESTful Web services:
    ‚úÖ Get  reporting  centre  services by postcode. The server should accept a ‚ÄògetServices‚Äô query from the client browser similar to ‚Äú/getServices?postcode=xxxx‚Äù. After processing this request, the service should return a HTML document containing the list of available services for a given postcode, including the following fields (attributes): 
        ‚úÖ Service, Suburb. 
    ‚úÖ Get reporting centre by service name. The server should accept a ‚ÄògetRCentre‚Äô query from  the client browser similar to ‚Äú/getRCentre?service=xxxx‚Äù. After processing this request, the service should return a HTML document containing the list of available reporting centres for a given service, including the following fields (attributes): 
        ‚úÖ CentreID, Suburb, Latitude, Longitude. 
    The Python Bottle and petl frameworks are required for this implementation. Data for the  service is from the output file ‚ÄúreportingCentre_service_locations.csv‚Äù of the integration demo.

Other features:
    ‚úÖ Input Error Handling
    ‚úÖ Clearly Documented
